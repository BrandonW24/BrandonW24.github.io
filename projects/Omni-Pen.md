## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Realistic Bowling Physics**  

   - *Challenge*: Making the ball behave like a real bowling ball with proper mass, friction, and hook potential  

   - *Solution*: Fine-tuned Rigidbody properties and implemented velocity buffering for accurate throw detection  

2. **Precise Pin Detection**  

   - *Challenge*: Reliably detecting when pins are knocked over without false positives  

   - *Solution*: Multi-threshold system checking angle, velocity, position change, and time-based cooldowns  

3. **Multiplayer Synchronization**  

   - *Challenge*: Keeping all clients in sync with ball positions, pin states, and scores  

   - *Solution*: Networked events for all major actions (throws, resets, scoring) with master client authority  

4. **Cross-Platform Controls**  

   - *Challenge*: Creating intuitive controls for both VR (motion) and desktop (mouse/keyboard)  

   - *Solution*: 
     - VR: Natural throwing with velocity tracking  
       - Desktop: Charge-and-release mechanics with trajectory preview  

5. **Dynamic Game State Management**  

   - *Challenge*: Managing player turns, frames, and scores across multiple players  

   - *Solution*: Queue-based turn system with frame tracking and network-synced scoreboards
